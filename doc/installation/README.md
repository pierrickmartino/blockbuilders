## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the BlockBuilders application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **pip**: Python package installer, typically included with Python.
- **Virtualenv**: To create isolated Python environments.
- **Git**: To clone the repository.

### Step-by-Step Installation Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the BlockBuilders repository:
    `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockbuilders.git cd blockbuilders`
    
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
    It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:    
    `` python3 -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate` ``
    
3. **Install Dependencies**:
    Install the required Python packages using pip:    
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    
4. **Environment Configuration**:
    - Copy the `example.env` file to `.env` and update the environment variables with your settings:  
        `cp example.env .env`
    
    - Edit the `.env` file to include your API keys and other configurations:
        `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key DATABASE_URL=your_database_url CRYPTOCOMPARE_API_KEY=your_cryptocompare_api_key`
    
5. **Apply Database Migrations**:
    Set up your database by applying the necessary migrations:
    `python manage.py migrate`
    
6. **Create a Superuser**:
    Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface:
    `python manage.py createsuperuser`
    
7. **Collect Static Files**:
    Collect all static files for the frontend:
    `python manage.py collectstatic`
    
8. **Run the Development Server**:
    Start the Django development server:
    `python manage.py runserver`
    
9. **Access the Application**:
    Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to see the BlockBuilders application in action.

### Additional Configuration (Optional)

- **Database Configuration**: If you want to use a different database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL), update the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file accordingly and ensure you have the necessary database drivers installed.
- **Static Files**: For production, ensure that your static files are properly configured and served by a web server such as Nginx.
- **Deployment**: For deploying to a production environment, consider using services like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean. Ensure you set the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` to `blockbuilders.settings.production` and configure your web server and WSGI application appropriately.
    
### Troubleshooting

- **Common Issues**:
    - If you encounter issues with dependencies, ensure your `pip` is up to date:
        `pip install --upgrade pip`
    - For database connection issues, verify your database URL and credentials in the `.env` file.

- **Logging and Debugging**:
    - Check the Django logs for any errors and refer to the official [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/) for troubleshooting tips.
