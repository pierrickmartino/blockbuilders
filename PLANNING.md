# Crypto Wallet Tracker - Project Planning

## Project Overview
The Crypto Wallet Tracker is a web application that allows users to monitor their cryptocurrency holdings across multiple wallets and exchanges. The application will provide real-time data on portfolio value, individual asset performance, transaction history, and market trends.

## Scope

### Core Features
1. **Account Management**
   - User registration and authentication
   - Profile management
   - Security features (2FA, email verification)

2. **Wallet Integration**
   - Manual wallet address entry
   - Support for major blockchains (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain, etc.)
   - Integration with wallet APIs where available
   - Read-only wallet tracking (no private key storage)

3. **Exchange Integration**
   - API connections to major exchanges
   - API key management with appropriate security measures
   - Regular synchronization of exchange data

4. **Portfolio Tracking**
   - Aggregated view of all assets across wallets and exchanges
   - Historical portfolio value tracking
   - Performance metrics (gains/losses)
   - Asset allocation visualization

5. **Transaction History**
   - Record of all transactions across connected wallets/exchanges
   - Transaction categorization
   - Transaction search and filtering
   - Tax reporting assistance (calculate gains/losses)

6. **Market Data**
   - Current prices, market caps, and 24h changes
   - Historical price charts
   - Basic market analytics

7. **Notifications & Alerts**
   - Price alerts
   - Significant transaction alerts
   - Security alerts

### Stretch Features (Future Versions)
- DeFi protocol integration
- NFT tracking
- Advanced analytics
- Mobile application
- Tax document generation
- Staking and yield tracking

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **Framework**: Next.js with App Router for optimal routing and server components
- **UI Library**: Tailwind CSS for styling, potentially with a component library like Shadcn UI
- **State Management**: React Context API for local state, SWR or React Query for data fetching
- **Authentication**: JWT with secure HTTP-only cookies
- **Charts**: Recharts or Chart.js for data visualization
- **API Communication**: Axios or fetch API with custom hooks

### Backend (Django REST Framework)
- **Framework**: Django with Django REST Framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data
- **Caching**: Redis for high-performance caching
- **Authentication**: Django Rest Knox or Simple JWT
- **Task Queue**: Celery for background tasks and scheduled jobs
- **API Documentation**: DRF Spectacular or drf-yasg

### Data Sources
- **Crypto APIs**: CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, or CryptoCompare for market data
- **Blockchain APIs**: Etherscan, BlockCypher, etc. for on-chain data
- **Exchange APIs**: Direct integration with major exchanges

### Deployment
- **Frontend**: Vercel or Netlify
- **Backend**: Docker containers on AWS, Digital Ocean, or similar
- **Database**: Managed PostgreSQL service
- **Caching**: Managed Redis service
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or similar for automated testing and deployment

## Security Considerations
- No private key storage
- Encrypted storage of API keys
- Rate limiting
- Input validation and sanitization
- HTTPS enforcement
- Regular security audits
- CSRF/XSS protection
- Regular dependency updates

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient API caching strategies
- Pagination for large datasets
- Optimized database queries
- Lazy loading of UI components
- CDN for static assets
- Responsive design for all devices

## Compliance
- GDPR compliance for user data
- Clear terms of service and privacy policy
- Appropriate disclaimers regarding financial information
- Compliance with cryptocurrency regulations in target jurisdictions

## Development Workflow
- Git-based version control with feature branches
- Code reviews for all PRs
- Automated testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Test-driven development where appropriate
- Documentation as part of the development process
- Regular sprint planning and retrospectives
